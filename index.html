            <h2 class="two">What does this aim to do: </h2>
            
            <p>
                - Reduce environmental impacts of Building<br/><br/>
                - Be energy efficient<br/><br/>
                - Be sustainable over time<br/><br/>
                - Using materials
                All achieved without compromising health, comfort or safety of occupants inside!<br/>
            </p>

            <h2 class="head3">Reducing Environmental Impacts</h2>
            <p>
                - Install low energy Systems such as heating and cooling systems.<br/>
                - Increase the amount of renewable energy is being created on site. <br/>
            </p>

            <h2 class="head3">Energy Efficiency</h2>
            <p>
                - Done by minimising the energy consumed through passive methods like: <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Insulation. This will minimise energy loss through heat.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Windows. This can help by letting in more natural light, reducing the need for artificial light.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They can also help by providing natural ventilation and triple glazing for insulation.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Double skin facades - air in between two bits of glass which helps insulation <br/>
            </p>

            <h2 class="head3">Sustainability</h2>
            <p>
                - Can be achieved by utilising renewable energy methods within the building: <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Solar panels on the roof<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Providing natural vegetation. <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Using materials that are long lasting, renewable and reliable. <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Reusing materials from deconstructed buildings, and use locally sourced materials. <br/>
            </p>

            <h2 class="head3">Use of materials</h2>
            <p>
                - Use of specific materials can help with sustainablility <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Use recyclable materials so they can be reused. <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; - Use natural materials - insulation made from materials like kelp, hemp, and bamboo. <br/>
            </p>

                Example building which uses large windows and natural vegetation to be more sustainable and efficient: <br/>

                Example building which uses double facade windows to improve insulation:

            <h2 class="head3">Why is it important</h2>
                <p>
                    Sustainable architecture is crucial for the future as it addresses the pressing challenges of climate change, resource depletion, and urbanisation that our generation will face. 
                    By incorporating renewable materials and energy-efficient designs, sustainable buildings can significantly reduce their environmental impact and promote healthier living conditions. 
                    This in turn will reduce carbon footprints.
